# crypto_investments
This is a python-jupyter notebook integrated development environment(IDE) based crypto investments analysis to clsuter cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. The notebook works as per the standard phases of finacial analysis by extracting data from CSV, preparation of datasets by cleaning the data and finally analyzing the data through quantitative analysis and visualizations. We use Python and the skllearn libraries/modules for the various steps involved from data preparation to visualization over Jupyter Notebook while applying basics of Machine Learning Concepts within Unsupervices Learning such as KMeans Alogrithm, Elbow Method and Principal Compenent Analysis(PCA) Method. 


## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) - Is a browser-based interface to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html) - Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. [scikit-learn user_guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) 


Note:
* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - hvplot makes interactive visualization available through Jypyter Notebook and Voil√†.

To access the Jupiter notebook, first install the following dependencies.

 [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

```python
# install conda dev environment and activate it
    conda update conda
    conda create -n dev python=3.7 anaconda
    conda activate dev
# install Jupyter Lab
    pip install jupyterlab

# To verify if you have scikit-learn and hvplot already installed
    conda list scikit-learn
    conda list hvplot
  
# Optional:    
# install scikit-learn
    pip install -U scikit-learn

# install hvPlot
    conda install -c pyviz hvplot

```

## Usage

To use the Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository and do not forget to run the above commands as applicable,

```git
git clone https://github.com/sidbetatester/crypto_investments.git
```

Upon launching the Jypyter notebook, you will notice an interface similar to the one below, click  on the 'crypto_investments.ipynb' file and you will have the complete analysis.
